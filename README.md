# PREVATOR

Create watch previews quickly and easily

### How it works

1. Select the desired device.
2. Upload a screenshot of the watch face or mini-app using the appropriate button.
3. Turn on the "decorations" in the form of an inner shadow and glare, if necessary.
4. If you are satisfied with the result, specify the file name (default is [devicename_preview.png]) and click Download.
5. Repeat steps 1-4 until you get bored.

#### Note: If you select a device with a different screen type (round > square or square > round), the image will be replaced with the default image, then you should select your screenshot again.
